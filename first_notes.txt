Fix grade estimation

Ubuntu 20.04, lets say 24.04 and MacOS (newest)

Does it really require a master key of 512 bits? I thought we said differently, I actually think this is right

System does not REQUIRE Linux, but likely requires unix. We say python 3.7 an dup in some and Python 3.9 in some.

What is MTU again?

"Semantic seurity was preserved throughout testing, confirming that identical plaintexts consistently producted different cyphertexts" Use a def for semantic security or rewrite

Were all these tests really perfect?? What are we testing?

Did we actually test SSH, http, etc?

How did we test network degradation?

Sliding Window Mechanism? What is that? But packet reordering is a good catch

I do support MacOS

Last paragraph of what can we do better is very wordy

After that is also very wordy. Fix that

Dont say that anything presented high difficulty. -> not hard to understand implications of IV reuse

Concepts reinforced might not be needed, if kept, make it breif.

STOP TALKING ABOUT IV reuse. Dont need Key Technical insights.

I swear, in software engineering lessons we talk about catchin gth eIV reuse bug, and use em dashes. Lets not do that.

WE DO NOT have teh complete implementation of the VPN.

Flow Charts are great but are cut off between pages, maybe remake with freeform

Great addition of estimated grade lmfao

All in all, good, but very repetitive, lets fix it.

Check sources are correct
